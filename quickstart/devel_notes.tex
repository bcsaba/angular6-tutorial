First you have to install the Angular CLI (potentially as root).

\begin{lstlisting}
  npm install -h @angular/cli
\end{lstlisting}


Now ou can create a new application:

\begin{lstlisting}
  ng new my_new_app
\end{lstlisting}

This generate a new project with a default application and supporting
files. The \lstinline$ng add$ command can be used to add pre-packaged
functionality to a new project. It applies schematics in the specified
package.

Serve teh application

\begin{lstlisting}
  cd m_new_app
  ng serve --open
\end{lstlisting}

This builds the app, starts the dev server, watches source files, and
rebuilds the app if flies change.

Angular component named
